**Improvements to be made**

* Only searches Sigma-Aldrich for SDS sheets, won't return anything if not in their catalogue. Maybe include other manufacturers
* Improve searching method to include CAS no. so that it's more definite
* Remove tabs from front page, improve general design
* Add validation (no blank field)
